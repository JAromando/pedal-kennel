Version 1.0.0
-------------

Operator's names can now be accessed with "op_name" instead of "op".

Nodes no longer have a .data_type field; instead you must use the data_type helper function
    
    from pedal.cait.cait_api import data_type
    names = ast.find_all("Name")
    data_type(names[0]).is_equal("StrType")

Various instructor_* libraries have been moved into pedal.toolkits and pedal.mistakes
    from instructor_printing -> from pedal.toolkit.printing import *
    from instructor_utility -> from pedal.toolkit.utilities import *

from pedal.toolkit.printing import *
from pedal.toolkit.utilities import *
from pedal.toolkit.functions import *

Still to fix:
#20??: Needs to point the exampe out to the correct place
#22.5: Need to fix output_test in toolkit.functions
#25.3: Needs to point the example out to the correct place
#25.4: WE

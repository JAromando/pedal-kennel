Important Concepts
==================

* *Report*: A collection of Feedback and a namespace for the results of Tools, accessible by the Tool name. Reports can be generated imperatively (using the default Report, similar to MatPlotLib) or by explicitly creating and passing Report objects.
* *Tool*: A system that can read and write to a Report, building on the work of previous Tools.
* *Resolver*: A system that can analyze a Report and create a relevant bit of output for another system (e.g., BlockPy, Web-CAT).
* *Feedback*: A structured representation of content to be delivered to a student in response to their submission of work.

We base our idea of "Feedback" on concepts established by Narciss 2006. Our Feedback objects are composed of up to 7 components:

* result (bool): Whether or not this feedback is associated with the learner completing the task ("Success!")
* performance (float): A relative amount that this feedback contributes to the students' performance (think in terms of partial credit, like "Triggering this feedback is worth 20%").
* misconceptions (Component): A description of the misconception that is believed to be in the student's mind, or perhaps the relevant concept from the material that should be associated with this. ("Variables must be initialized before they are used.")
* mistakes (Component): A description of the error or bug that the student has created ("NameError on line 5: sum has not been defined")
* hints (Component): A suggestion for what the student can do ("Initialize the sum variable one line 1")
* constraints (Component): A description of the task requirements or task type that the student has violated ("You used a for loop, but this question expected you to use recursion.")
* metacognitives (Component): A suggestion for more regulative strategies ("You have been working for 5 hours, perhaps it is time to take a break?")

One of these components is described by the following union type, where a Component is one of:

* A str field representing renderable text for a student
* An object with a "message (str)" field of renderable text for a student, along with whatever other fields are useful (e.g., the line number of the error)
* A list of Components

Additionally, a given Feedback object has the following metadata:

* label (str): An internal name for this specific piece of feedback. This is particularly useful for us for research purposes (we currently show it in italics as part of the message)
* tool (str): An internal name for indicating the tool that created this feedback (e.g., "tifa" or "source")
* category (str): A human-presentable name showable to a student (this is like the "Analyzer Error" message in the top left of our BlockPy boxes).
* priority (str): An indication of how important this feedback is. Might be "high/medium/low" or the name of a category to supersede.

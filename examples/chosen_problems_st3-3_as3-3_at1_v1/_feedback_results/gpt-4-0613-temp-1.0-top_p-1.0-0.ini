description = Define the function `high_score` that consumes a list of integers (representing scores in a game) and produces an integer representing the highest score in the list. Ignore scores less than `100`, and stop processing values if you encounter `-999`. If the list is empty, return the value `None` instead. It is up to you to decompose this function (or not) however you want.

gpt_feedback = Your code seems to be set up correctly to handle empty and low-score lists, but there's a problem with the way you're using the break statement. The break is used to exit the closest enclosing loop, which in this case would be the for loop. However, if your score equals -999, you don't necessarily want to exit the entire function, but just ignore that specific score. Instead of using break, you could continue with the loop and check if the score is not equal to -999 before checking if it's greater than or equal to 'to_return'.

gpt_feedback = Your code seems to have an error. The variable 'score' is not yet defined in the line where you assign it to the variable 'maximum'. Did you perhaps mean to use the variable 'scores'? Also, your function is expected to return the highest score. But it currently returns None if it encounters a score less than 100 in the list.

gpt_feedback = Your function seems logically fine up to the point where you calculate the maximum number. However, there are a few issues that need to be corrected:
	
	1. You do not need to check for `score==-999:` twice in your function. You can remove one of them.
	2. Your function should continue to check for scores even if it finds a score that is less than `mini`. So, there is no need to `continue` when `score < mini`. 
	3. You return the `max_num` immediately when you find a score greater than the current `max_num` but, you should let the loop run for all elements then return the `max_num` after the loop is over.
	4. Your check for an empty list can be simplified to `if not scores:`. This check if the list is empty.
	
	Correct these issues and try running your program again.

In the function's current state, it might incorrectly return this score as the highest, even if it doesn't meet the criterion of being at least 100. To address this, consider starting `highest_score` at zero, and include an additional check to ensure that any score considered 'highest' must also be greater than or equal to 100.

You stop your count when your number is -999 but then also check if that -999 is greater than or equal to 100 which will never be true. Also, it seems your assertion is failing because you initiate your max variable with the first value of the list, so if the first value is the highest, even if the count stops, it's this value that gets returned.

description = The dataclass `Job` is defined below with the fields `title` (str), `salary` (int), `available` (boolean), and `company` (str).
	
	Define a function `best_job` that consumes a list of jobs and returns the `Job` with the highest `salary` that is `available`. If no jobs are available, then return the default `UNEMPLOYED` job instead.
	
	You will need to unit test your code a sufficient number of times.
	
	**HINT**: Define a helper function to filter out the unavailable jobs BEFORE you determine the highest salary `Job`. An `if` statement used as a Defensive Guard will be very effective for returning the appropriate value in the case where there are no available guards. Having two helper functions (one to filter available jobs, and one to determine the highest salary) in addition to the main `best_job` function makes this a lot easier to keep track of everything.

You can add elements to this list using the `append` method or by using the `+` operator.
